# Binary Tree Sorting and Search Visualization


A C++ project that demonstrates and visualizes sorting and search algorithms on binary trees. The program allows users to input the number of nodes and a target node to search for, displaying step-by-step how the tree is constructed and how comparisons are made during the search process.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tree Construction**: Visualizes the step-by-step construction of a binary tree based on user input.
- **Search Algorithm Visualization**: Demonstrates how the search algorithm traverses the tree and compares nodes.
- **Interactive Input**: Users can specify the number of nodes and the target node to search for.
- **Graphical Output**: Utilizes a graphical module to display the tree and algorithm steps in real-time.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of nodes for the binary tree when prompted.
2. Enter the target node you want to search for.
3. Observe the graphical output as the tree is constructed and the search algorithm is executed step-by-step.

The program will display:

- The tree being constructed node by node.
- The search algorithm comparing nodes and highlighting the traversal path.
